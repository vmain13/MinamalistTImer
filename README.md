Minimalist Timer™ is the ultimate minimalist workout timer. We decided to build an easy-to-use iOS app that met our needs and nothing else.

While all iPhones are equipped with a countdown timer, this timer includes rest and work intervals as determined by the user and a convenient database of workouts.

To test out our application, click the green download button https://github.com/vmain13/MinamalistTImer. Open the optimalliving.xcodeproj file in the Minimalist
Timer folder in Xcode and the program will pull from the other files as necessary. To begin the test, click the play button in the top left corner of Xcode and Xcode Simulator
will launch. We optimized Minimalist Timer™ for the iPhone 8 and recommend running the simulator as such. We did, however, test
across other iPhones to ensure sufficient compatibility.

We have submitted Minimalist Timer™ to the iOS app store and hope to have it accepted and available over the next couple of days.

The user then encounters a screen labeled, Your Workouts. Here they may select from a list of pre-entered exercises that have their
respective work periods, rest periods, reps and sets labeled, or enter their own exercises via the + icon in the top right corner.

To begin a workout, the user simply presses the desired routine on the Your Workouts page. The work period countdown then launches
upon pressing the start button on the timer page and a minimalist tone sounds as the period ends. The timer immediately transitions
to the rest period and is again followed by the pleasing sounds of a minimalist tone.

While the timer is in action, users may pause at any time and/or reset the timer as necessary. If one resets during a rest period, the rest timer goes to zero and the user will then resume with a work period (there would be no need to pause and resume a rest!). Once all the required work intervals are completed, the user is brought back to their workouts page.
